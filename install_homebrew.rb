# 30th March 2010:
#   Added a check to make sure user is in the staff group. This was a problem
#   for me, and I think it was due to me migrating my account over several
#   versions of OS X. I cannot verify that for sure, and it was tested on
#   10.6.2 using the Directory Service command line utility and my laptop.
#
#   My assumptions are:
#     - you are running OS X 10.6.x
#     - your machine is not managed as part of a group using networked
#       Directory Services
#     - you have not recently killed any baby seals or kittens

#   Adapted CodeButler's fork: http://gist.github.com/331512

This script requires the user #{ENV['USER']} to be in the staff group. If this
sucks for you then you can install Homebrew in your home directory or however
you please; please refer to the website. If you still want to use this script
the following command should work:
