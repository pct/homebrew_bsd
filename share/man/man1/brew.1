.SH "NAME"
\fBbrew\fR \- The missing package manager for OS X
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBbrew\fR [\-\-verbose|\-v] command [options] [formula] \.\.\.
.
.br
\fBbrew\fR [\-\-version|\-v]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didn\'t include with OS X\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR command [options] [formula] \.\.\.
Prints extra, comand\-specific debugging information\. Note that \fBbrew \-v\fR by itself is the same as \fBbrew \-\-version\fR\.
.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print the version number of brew to standard error and exit\.
.
.TP
\fBinstall [\-\-force] [\-\-debug] [\-\-use\-llvm] [\-\-ignore\-dependencies] [\-\-HEAD]\fR \fIformula\fR
Install \fIformula\fR\.
.
.IP
\fIformula\fR is usually the name of the formula to install, but may also be the URL for an arbitrary formula\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-force\fR is passed, will install \fIformula\fR even if it is already installed\. This can be used to re\-install a formula without removing it first\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-debug\fR is passed and brewing fails, open a shell inside the temporary folder used for compiling\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-use\-llvm\fR is passed, attempt to compile using the LLVM front\-end to GCC\. \fINOTE\fR: Not all formulae will build with LLVM\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-ignore\-dependencies\fR is passed, skip installing any dependencies of any kind\. If they are not already present, the formula will probably fail to install\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-HEAD\fR is passed, and \fIformula\fR defines it, install the HEAD version, aka master, trunk, unstable, dev\.
.
.IP
To install a newer version of HEAD use \fBbrew rm <foo> && brew install \-\-HEAD <foo>\fR or \fBbrew install \-\-force \-\-HEAD <foo>\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBinstall \-\-interactive [\-\-git]\fR \fIformula\fR
Download and patch \fIformula\fR, then open a shell\. This allows the user to run \fB\./configure \-\-help\fR and otherwise determine how to turn the software package into a Homebrew formula\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-git\fR is passed, Homebrew will create a Git repository, useful for creating patches to the software\.
.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fBsearch\fR \fItext\fR|/\fItext\fR/
Perform a substring search of formula names for \fItext\fR\. If \fItext\fR is surrounded with slashes, then it is interpreted as a regular expression\. If no search term is given, all available formula are displayed\.
.
.TP
\fB\-S \-\-macports\fR|\fB\-\-fink\fR \fItext\fR
Search for \fItext\fR on the MacPorts or Fink package search page\.
.
.TP
\fBupdate\fR
Fetch the newest version of Homebrew from GitHub using \fBgit\fR(1)\.
.
.TP
\fBlist\fR

.
.TP
\fBlist\fR \fIformula\fR
List the installed files for \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR \fIformula\fR
Display information about \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo \-\-github\fR \fIformula\fR
Open a browser to the GitHub History page for formula \fIformula\fR\.
.
.IP
To view formula history locally: \fBbrew log \-p <formula>\fR\.

\fBrm\fR, \fBremove\fR, \fBuninstall [\-\-force]\fR \fIformula\fR
Uninstall \fIformula\fR\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-force\fR is passed, and there are multiple versions of \fIformula\fR installed, delete all installed versions\.
.
.TP
\fBcreate [\-\-cache]\fR \fIURL\fR
Generate a formula for the downloadable file at \fIURL\fR and opens it in $EDITOR\. Homebrew will attempt to automatically derive the formula name and version, if it fails, you\'ll have to make your own template\. I suggest copying wget\'s\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-cache\fR is passed, Homebrew will download the \fIURL\fR to the cache and add the MD5 to the formula for you\.
.
.TP
\fBedit\fR \fIformula\fR
Open \fIformula\fR in $EDITOR\.
.
.TP
\fBedit\fR
Open all of Homebrew for editing in TextMate\.
.
.TP
\fBln\fR, \fBlink\fR \fIformula\fR
Symlink all of \fIformula\fR\'s installed files into the Homebrew prefix\. This is done automatically when you install formula\. It is useful for DIY installation, or in cases where you want to swap out different versions of the same package that you have installed at the same time\.
.
.TP
\fBunlink\fR \fIformula\fR
Unsymlink \fIformula\fR from the Homebrew prefix\. This can be useful for temporarily disabling a formula: \fBbrew unlink foo && commands && brew link foo\fR\.

\fBfetch [\-\-force] [\-v] [\-\-HEAD]\fR \fIformula\fR
Download the source package for the given \fIformula\fR\. For tarballs, also prints MD5 and SHA1 checksums\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-HEAD\fR is passed, download the HEAD version of \fIformula\fR instead\. \fB\-v\fR may also be passed to make the VCS checkout verbose, useful for seeing if an existing HEAD cache has been updated\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-force\fR is passed, remove a previously cached version and re\-fetch\.
.
.TP
\fBaudit [\-\-warn]\fR
Check formulae for Homebrew coding style violations\. This should be run before submitting a new formula for inclusion\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-warn\fR is passed, perform additional stricter checks that may not need to be fixed before submitting\.
.
.TP
\fBoptions\fR \fIformula\fR
Display install options specific to \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBmissing\fR
Check all installed formuale for missing dependencies\.

.
.TP
\fBtest\fR \fIformula\fR
A few formulae provide a test method\. \fBbrew test <formula>\fR runs this test method\. There is no standard output or return code, but it should generally indicate to the user if something is wrong with the installed formula\.
.
.IP
Example: \fBbrew install jruby && brew test jruby\fR
.
.TP

Display Homebrew\'s install path\. \fIDefault:\fR \fB/usr/local\fR
.
.TP
\fB\-\-prefix\fR \fIformula\fR
Display the location in the cellar where \fIformula\fR is or would be installed\.
.
.TP

Display where Homebrew\'s \fB\.git\fR folder is located\. For standard installs, the \fBprefix\fR and \fBrepository\fR are the same folder\.
.
.SH "EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
Homebrew allows external commands to be defined by putting a +x file named \fBbrew\-<cmdname>\fR or \fBbrew\-<cmdname>\.rb\fR on the PATH\. This will cause Homebrew to recognize \fBbrew cmdname\fR\.
.
.P
Some sample commands ship with Homebrew and are enabled by default\.
.
.IP "" 4

.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_DEBUG
If set, instructs Homebrew to always assume \fB\-\-debug\fR when running commands\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_DEBUG_INSTALL
When \fBbrew install \-d\fR or \fBbrew install \-i\fR drops into a shell, \fBHOMEBREW_DEBUG_INSTALL\fR will be set to the name of the formula being brewed\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_DEBUG_PREFIX
When \fBbrew install \-d\fR or \fBbrew install \-i\fR drops into a shell, \fBHOMEBREW_DEBUG_PREFIX\fR will be set to the target prefix in the Cellar of the formula being brewed\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_EDITOR
If set, Homebrew will use this editor when editing a single formula, or several formulae in the same folder\.
.
.IP
\fINOTE\fR: \fBbrew edit\fR will open all of Homebrew as discontinuous files and folders\. TextMate can handle this correctly in project mode, but many editors will do strange things in this case\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_KEEP_INFO
If set, Homebrew will not remove files from \fBshare/info\fR, allowing them to be linked from the Cellar\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_SVN
When exporting from Subversion, Homebrew will use \fBHOMEBREW_SVN\fR if set, a Homebrew\-built Subversion if installed, or the system\-provided binary\.
.
.IP
Set this to force Homebrew to use a particular svn binary\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_TEMP
If set, instructs Homebrew to use \fBHOMEBREW_TEMP\fR as the temporary folder for building packages\. This may be needed if your system temp folder and Homebrew Prefix are on different volumes, as OS X has trouble moving symlinks across volumes when the target does not yet exist\.
.
.IP
This issue typically occurs when using FileVault or custom SSD configurations\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_USE_LLVM
If set, instructs Homebrew to use the LLVM front\-ends to the GCC compilers\.
.
.IP
\fINOTE\fR: Not all formulae build correctly with LLVM\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_VERBOSE
If set, instructs Homebrew to always assume \fB\-\-verbose\fR when running commands\.
.
.SH "USING HOMEBREW BEHIND A PROXY"
Homebrew uses several commands for downloading files (e\.g\. curl, git, svn)\. Many of these tools can download via a proxy\. It\'s common for these tools to read proxy parameters from environment variables\.
.
.P
For the majority of cases setting \fBhttp_proxy\fR is enough\. You can set this in your shell profile, or you can use it before a brew command:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

http_proxy=http://<host>:<port> brew install foo
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
If your proxy requires authentication:
